===== Go =====

go run to run commands
go build to compile

(Cross-compiling)

You can specify the os and architecture with:
GOOS="linux" GOARCH="amd64" go build <file name>

go doc to provide documentation about any commands (go doc fmt.Println)

go get to import third-party packages
the downloads are placed in your GOPATH/src directory

go fmt formats your source code
golint for style mistakes (go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint)
go vet hardens code by checking for missed mistakes/potential bugs
go test // cover // imports also help refine code
