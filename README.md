# Hacking Toolkit

This is a expanding repo full of helpful scripts used for hacking.

I intend to start small and expand each for custom projects.

Ultimately, I would like to build a toolkit that I can easily pull from device to device.

It will also serve as a sandbox for skilling up and testing code // new languages.

### =======

The idea is to:
  1. Write out useful programs related to Hacking
  2. Refactor the code for efficiency
  3. Rewrite the code in various languages
  4. Integrate Automation
